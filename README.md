1. /short-summary
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/short-summary" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is a legal contract. you can assume some things that are heppening in this document"
  }'
```

``` 
RESPONSE:

{"summary":"The provided text states only that the document is a legal contract.  Without the actual content of the contract, a meaningful legal analysis is impossible.  To provide a summary as requested, the specific terms and conditions of the contract are absolutely necessary.  The following is a template of what the analysis *would* contain if the contract text were provided:\n\n\n**Legal Document Analysis (Template)**\n\n**Type of Document:**  (This would be determined from the contract's content. Examples: Rental Lease Agreement, Loan Agreement, Terms of Service, Employment Contract, etc.)\n\n**Parties Involved:** (This section would name the specific parties involved,  e.g., \"Landlord: John Smith; Tenant: Jane Doe\" or \"Company: Acme Corp; User:  Robert Jones\").\n\n**Key Obligations:**  (This section would detail the key obligations of each party as explicitly stated in the contract. For example, a tenant's obligation to pay rent, maintain the property in good condition, or adhere to specific rules; a landlord's obligation to provide habitable premises, make necessary repairs, etc.)\n\n**Important Clauses:** (This would highlight any significant clauses, such as those pertaining to termination (e.g., notice periods, grounds for termination), penalties for breach of contract (e.g., late fees, liquidated damages), dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., arbitration, mediation, litigation), and liability limitations.)\n\n\n**Potential Risks:** (This would identify any potential risks or negative consequences for either party,  such as the financial risks associated with a loan agreement, potential for eviction in a lease, or limitations on liability in a terms of service agreement).\n\n\n**Overall Purpose:** (This section would explain the core objective of the contract in plain language. For example, \"This rental agreement establishes the terms under which John Smith leases his property to Jane Doe,\" or \"This contract outlines the terms and conditions governing the use of Acme Corp's software by Robert Jones.\")\n\n\nIn short, providing a proper legal analysis requires the actual contract text.  The current prompt only offers a statement that a legal contract exists, rendering a substantive analysis impossible."}

2. /risk-summary
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/risk-analysis" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This legal contract establishes a commercial arrangement between the parties, but contains several clauses that may present material risks. The limitation of liability provision appears excessively broad, potentially leaving one party without meaningful remedies in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnification clause is unilateral, requiring only one party to assume extensive financial responsibility for third-party claims. Additionally, the termination rights are asymmetrical, permitting one party to exit the agreement with minimal notice while restricting the other party‚Äôs ability to do so. Confidentiality obligations are vaguely defined, creating uncertainty about the scope of protected information and potential exposure to liability. Finally, the absence of a clear dispute resolution mechanism may increase the likelihood of costly litigation."
  }'

RESPONSE:
{"risk_alerts":["‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK: Limited legal recourse for negligence","‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK: One-sided financial responsibility","‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK: Unequal termination rights","üü° MEDIUM RISK: Unclear confidentiality rules","üü° MEDIUM RISK: No clear dispute resolution"]}

    "text": "This is a legal contract. you can assume some things that are heppening in this document"
  }'
```

``` 
RESPONSE:

{"paragraph_summaries":{"Paragraph 1":"Plain English: This is a legally binding agreement.  Why it matters: This means everything written here is enforceable by law; if either party breaks the agreement, there could be legal consequences."}}%

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/glossary-definitions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
